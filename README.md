## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="success" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}

> asdfasdl alksd 
>
> dfas df;laks 
>
> > sdf as da fsdkj f
> >
> > dfa sd fas
> >
> > > asdf asdfa;sd

{% code title="sdf.sh" %}
```bash
asdfasdf a
```
{% endcode %}
